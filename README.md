# Baseball 101

## Introduction
Baseball 101 provides the user with the task of guessing a player as quickly as possible as their statistics are displayed year-by-year.

## How to Play
The basic rules of the game are as follows:
1. The user is initially displayed with nothing but the silhouette of the player's image, and their score is set initially to 101.
2. The user can hit the "Hint" button at any time to be displayed with the next year of the player's statistics. Each press of the "Hint" button will subtract 5 points from the user's score.
3. If at any point, the user thinks they know which player the data belongs to, they can type in the player's name in the search bar at the top.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;a. Clicking the player's name submits the guess
<br>&emsp;&emsp;b. If the guess is correct, the player's name and image is displayed and the score is locked in.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;c. If the guess is incorrect, nothing is revealed and 15 points are subtracted.
